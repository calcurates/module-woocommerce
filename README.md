### Calcurates WooCommerce module

Calcurates is a cloud-based entire shipping solution that calculates and shows the right shipping methods and rates to customers at checkout based on multiple conditions. It helps e-commerce to seamlessly integrate with major shipping carriers (DHL, UPS, FedEx, USPS, Purolator, Canada Post and more) in order to display real-time rates at checkout.

Calcurates helps you to reduce the gap between true shipping costs you bear and shipping rates your customers pay at the checkout. Bring your shipping to a new level and make it cost-effective and sales-stimulating.
